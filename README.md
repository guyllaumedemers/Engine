# Opengl-Danmaku

### Danmaku, Bullet hell

**Wikipedia** : "Bullet hell (danmaku, literally "barrage" or "bullet curtain"), also known as manic shooter, is a subgenre of shoot 'em up video games featuring large amounts of projectiles the player character is required to dodge."

#### Project

A `Sandbox` project built with Multithreading support. Objective being that `Core` systems manage their entities concurently for better performance. Additionaly, tooling will be provided to ease the testing process in the creation of complex `Danmaku`.

#### What this README.md is not

Be aware that this project isn't about building a `Game Engine`, explaining `Build system` or `Multithreading`. Even though the aim remains writing good `code`, code architecture might not always respect best practices or be optimized.

## JIRA

### Danmaku

In this [guide](https://sparen.github.io/ph3tutorials/ddsga2.html), we will discuss the role angles play in bullet movement as well as how bullet graphic choice affects the aesthetics of a pattern, as well as how Bullet Hell games differ from other shmups.
