# Engine

### Game Engine, Application Framework

**Wikipedia** : "A game engine is a software framework primarily designed for the development of video games and generally includes relevant libraries and support programs such as a level editor."

#### Project

A `Sandbox` project built for engine development. Objective being that `Core` systems can be reused accross multiple projects and provide an `Application Framework` that's robuste. Additionaly, tooling will be provided to ease the testing of specific systems and offer extendable features that can be implemented in project specific use cases.

#### What this README.md is not

Be aware that this project is greatly influenced by `Unreal Engine` as this is an industry standard and a **GREAT** study case for learning cross-platform development, system architecture, and more...

## An introduction to Cross-platform

**Wikipedia** : "In computing, cross-platform software (also called multi-platform software, platform-agnostic software, or platform-independent software) is computer software that is designed to work in several computing platforms."

### Platform layer

**Wikipedia** : "A computing platform, digital platform, or software platform is an environment in which software is executed. It may be the hardware or the operating system (OS), a web browser and associated application programming interfaces, or other underlying software, as long as the program code is executed using the services provided by the platform. Computing platforms have different abstraction levels, including a computer architecture, an OS, or runtime libraries."
